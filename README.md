Kaggle Porto Seguro’s Safe Driver Prediction

In this project we are trying to understand how good a driver is, whether
he/she will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year,
which will help companies accordingly predict the correct cost
of insurance for a driver based on it’s driver skill.

INTRODUCTION

Porto Seguro, the leader on the auto and homeowner insurance segments in Brazil which has around 10 million clients all
over the different business lines, completely agrees with this
situation faced by the drivers. Inaccuracies in car insurance
company’s claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for
good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones.

Project Outline

 PHASE 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
 PHASE 2: Feature selection and engineering
 PHASE 3: Model building
 PHASE 4: Model selection and final submission

Models used:
  
  1. Logistic Regression (Ginni score = 0.21560)
  2. Decision Tree (Ginni score = 0.21730)
  3. Random Forest (Ginni score = 0.26178)
  4. XG Boost (Ginni score = 0.29023)
  
Final Submission: XG Boost (Ginni score = 0.29023)
